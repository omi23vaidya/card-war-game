# card-war-game
A java application for the classic two player card war game. 

Rules of the game:
One deck of 52 cards is shuffled and dealt evenly between two players. During each play, each player lays down one card face up. The player with the higher ranking card (aces are high, suits (clubs, diamonds, spades, hearts) are ignored) takes both cards and add them to the bottom of his or her deck. If the cards are equal, a "war" ensues. The current cards are left in play. Each player plays another card face down, then another card face up. The player with the higher face up card takes all the cards that are in play and adds them to bottom of his or her deck. If the face up cards are still equal, the war continues until one player plays a higher card. When one player's cards are exhausted, he or she shuffles and play continues. Play ends when one player has won all the cards.

The repository contains the following:
1. src folder which contains all the java files and class files along with the algorithm of the code
2. Launch_Game named Batch File which would run the code on double clicking
3. WarGame named Runnable Jar File
4. Test Document

On running Launch_Game by double clicking, an output file called output.txt is created which has the output of the program.
